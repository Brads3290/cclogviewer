   - Lower cyclomatic complexity below 10

3. **[03-add-documentation.md](03-add-documentation.md)** - **HIGH**
   - Add godoc comments for all exported functions and types
   - Document complex algorithms
   - Create package-level documentation

4. **[04-eliminate-code-duplication.md](04-eliminate-code-duplication.md)** - **MEDIUM-HIGH**
   - Remove duplicate function definitions
   - Create shared utilities
   - Consolidate repeated patterns

5. **[05-improve-api-design.md](05-improve-api-design.md)** - **MEDIUM**
   - Create consistent function signatures
   - Hide implementation details
   - Implement builder patterns

6. **[06-remove-dead-code.md](06-remove-dead-code.md)** - **MEDIUM**
   - Remove unused functions and types
   - Clean up abandoned architecture
   - Delete unused struct fields

7. **[07-add-comprehensive-testing.md](07-add-comprehensive-testing.md)** - **HIGH**
   - Increase test coverage from 6.2% to 50%+
   - Add integration tests
   - Create test fixtures and helpers

8. **[08-extract-magic-values.md](08-extract-magic-values.md)** - **LOW-MEDIUM**
   - Extract hardcoded numbers and strings
   - Create constants package
   - Improve code readability

## Implementation Guidelines

### Order of Execution

The tasks should be completed in the order listed above. This sequence ensures:
- Architectural issues are fixed before adding features
- Complex code is simplified before documenting
- Dead code is removed before testing
- Foundation is solid before polishing

### Dependencies Between Tasks

- Task 1 (Architecture) must be completed first as it affects all other tasks
- Task 2 (Complexity) should be done before Task 3 (Documentation) to avoid documenting code that will change
- Task 4 (Duplication) should be done before Task 5 (API Design) to avoid redesigning duplicate code
- Task 6 (Dead Code) should be done before Task 7 (Testing) to avoid testing unused code

### Time Estimates

Based on the scope of each task:
- Task 1: 3-5 days (major refactoring)
- Task 2: 2-3 days
- Task 3: 2-3 days
- Task 4: 1-2 days
- Task 5: 2-3 days
- Task 6: 1 day
- Task 7: 3-4 days
- Task 8: 1 day

**Total estimated time: 16-24 days**

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Create a branch for each task** to allow easy rollback
2. **Run tests after each change** to ensure no regressions
3. **Keep the existing code working** during refactoring
4. **Document decisions** as you make them
5. **Get code reviews** for major architectural changes

### Success Metrics

After completing all tasks:
- Test coverage > 50%
- No functions > 50 lines
- All exported APIs documented
- No circular dependencies
- Clean, consistent API design
- No dead code
- All magic values extracted

## Notes

- Tasks marked as "Non-issue" in the original assessment have been excluded
- Security vulnerabilities (command injection, path traversal) should be fixed immediately if not already addressed
- Performance improvements have been noted but not prioritized as separate tasks
- Some improvements may reveal additional issues - update tasks as needed
